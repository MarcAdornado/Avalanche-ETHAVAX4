**Description**

DegenToken is an ERC-20 token built using Solidity. It introduces unique features like item redemption and an inventory system while supporting standard ERC-20 functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

**FEATURES**

Minting: The contract owner can mint new tokens and assign them to specified addresses.

Token Transfers: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses using the transferToken function.

Burning: Any token holder can burn their own tokens, reducing the total supply.

Item Redemption:Users can redeem tokens for in-game items using the redeemItem function.

Available items and their costs:

  *KARAMBIT: 20 tokens
  
  *AK-47: 15 tokens
  
  *M4A1-S: 10 tokens
  
Inventory Tracking: The contract maintains an inventory for each user, recording the items they have redeemed.

Check Balance: Users can check their token balance with the checkToken function.
